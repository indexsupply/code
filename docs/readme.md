## Versioning

Index Supply uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

Each component accepts a `-version` flag which will print the version along with a git commit hash and then exit.

Currently both Shovel and Block API are version: v0.0.1. The software has been thoroughly tested but not widely deployed. It has a stable foundation but may lack all the necessary features for an easy win. Stay tuned for updates.
